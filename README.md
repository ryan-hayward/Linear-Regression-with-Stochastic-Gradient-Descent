# Linear-Regression-with-Stochastic-Gradient-Descent
Program uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) in calculating linear regression.  Program also utilizes Stochastic Gradient Descent in order to reduce the MSE for the data (finds a near-optimal linear regression fit).

The data in question is Ice Coverage intervals on Lake Mendota in Madison, Wisconsin from 1855 to 2019 (excluding unavailable years). The data was cleaned before analysis in Python. The cleaned data can be found in the .csv file in this repository titled 'CleanIceData.csv'
